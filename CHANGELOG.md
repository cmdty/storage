## Python PIP Package Releases
### 1.0.0
* Update pythonnet dependency from 2.5.1 to 2.5.2.

### 1.1.0
* Update pythonnet dependency from 2.5.1 to 3.0.1 to allow compatibility with Python up to version 3.11.

### 1.2.0
* Addition of `value_from sims` function which allows users to provide their
own price simulation data.
* Markovian factors included in returned type for both C# and Python.
* Error raised if CmdtyStorage instance created with step ratchets, but 
terminal_storage_npv not specified, as this virtually always results in an 
error during the valuation.

### 1.3.0
* .NET binaries included in Python package target .NET Standard, not .NET Framework, hence compatible with
more .NET types.
* For non-Windows OS default to trying .NET (Core), rather than Mono as default runtime.

### 1.4.0
* sim_data_returned added to Monte Carlo valuation functions to allow the caller to control which simulation-level
data is returned.

### 1.5.0
* Update pythonnet dependency to <3.1.0. This allows reference to the latest version (3.0.3) which is compatible with Python up to version 3.12.
* Add standard error to results.

### 1.6.0 (Not yet released)
* Fix bug [#52](https://github.com/cmdty/storage/issues/52) in standard error calculation.
* Add standard error for delta.

## NuGet Package Releases
### 1.1.0
* SimulationDataReturned enum defined and property of this type added to LsmcValuationParameters to allow the caller to control which simulation-level
data is populated in the returned LsmcStorageValuationResults instance.

### 1.2.0 (Not yet released)
* Add standard error for NPV and delta.
